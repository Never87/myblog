英文翻译太过生硬
Let me briefly explain why I created this blog website. Let's start from the beginning. After getting into this so-called "innovative class," I followed through on a promise I made with my classmates to get into informatics competition—one of the five major high school academic competitions, known as the Olympiad in Informatics. At first, I thought, "With my strong math skills and some programming background, this should be a breeze!" But reality was a whole different story... Including the other four competitions, most participants had started learning from elementary or middle school, building a solid foundation. And me? I was in high school and knew nothing about algorithms. Okay, let's look at the math-related parts, "Hmm, I think this should be manageable since I also have..." Linear algebra, calculus, number theory, group theory, graph theory... "What?! Oh, I must have misread that. Let me check again..." Mathematical induction, probability theory, game theory, solving approximate bounds... "Oh no! It's true! We're doomed!" Well, these topics are manageable, just a bit overwhelming, not impossible. So I studied, and studied, and studied... and then the competition came. I scored 25 points... I looked at the questions and froze. What was this? It was nothing like I expected! At that moment, my classmate sent me a link. A elementary school student had skipped the problem I struggled with for hours and got wrong, and proceeded to solve the next three difficult ones in one go... Haha, I wanted to laugh but couldn't. I laughed because I saw an idiot who took four hours to get 25 points (out of 400), and I couldn't laugh because that idiot was me... Then I flipped through the rankings, curious about how the pros wrote their code. As I flipped, I came across a blog supposedly written by a middle school student! One of the articles said how to make your blog look better, which frankly, made me want to scream, but I had no reason to... After some time, I thought about this again, and since I had some free time, I decided to create this blog. After all, the truth that "if others have it, I should too" has been around for thousands of years, right... So I made this thing. That's all. Oh, wait, you might wonder why I translated it into English. Well, it's because I don't want my classmates to understand it at first glance. I'm afraid of losing face......
